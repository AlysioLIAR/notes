Hi! Here are some things that happened this week. 
- I went to Annecy for [this mini-workshop on the S-matrix bootstrap](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/33034/overview). It was pretty fun, and a good occasion to catch up with some people. 
  It was very chill, with a clear focus on everyone enjoying the day and making the most from their visit in Annecy.
  It was also a good opportunity to get an overview of what some of the younger people in the bootstrap community are working on, especially locally. 
- I watched [this interview of Chris Palmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GVInaBCn_c) in which he explains the root of mental health disorders in metabolism. He goes on to suggest a link between the global dietary issues and the current mental health crisis. 
  I'm pretty sympathetic to this hypothesis, and it gives me yet another reason to be mindful of what I eat and how I want to live my life in relation to food. 
- I listened to some recent interviews of Simon Sinek (it has been quite a long time since I had listened to him talk), and was reminded at how good of a speaker he is. It made me think about my own friendships, and ways I could (and certainly should) handle them better.
